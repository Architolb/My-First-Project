                <h1>Who AM I?</h1>
                <strong><small>I am glad you asked!</strong>
                <p>My name is Brandon Tolbert and I am a software engineer. I create value with my code and what it can do for you. I am a Texas based Army veteran who has been excelling in the tech industry for the past 7 years. I graduated from Rice University with my B.S in Biomechanics and Kinesiology.
                I worked for a food brokerage in Houston, Tx for a year as an administrtive consultant. After a year of that I decided to use my degree and started work as a Physical therapy technician in Dallas, Tx helping recently injured clients get back to a better quality of life. I also became a personal trainer at Gold's Gym training clients reach their optimum potetntial in weight loss and muscle gain. 
                I excelled as a personal trainer and was awarded the distinction of being the best Golds Personal trainer in the entire Southwest Region of the US. I soon set my sites on serving my country and decided to join the Army. I joined the armed forces as a multichannel communications operator and maintainer. Alot of words to say 
                I worked with Satellites to ensure our troops on the ground had reliable communications to our allies. I spent a little over 4 years in the Army and achieved all I wanted to achieve and decided it was time to go back to the civilian sector in order to be home more for my wife and I's newly born son. I took the knowledge I gained from the military and 
                began my carrer in IT Support where I cut my teeth in the tech arena. I fell in love and never looked back.I earned a postion with Amazon AWS as a Premium Support Engineer. I am currently learning as much as I can about different coding languages (Python and Java Script) in order to improve my coding skill set. I look forward to the hardwork and and dedication it will take to turn me into the future coder I aim to be!

                <h1>What do I do for fun?</h1>
                <strong>Here is what I like to do outside of coding!</strong>

               </fiigure>
                <p>My family considers me the trivia guy as I know a little about mostly everything or can quickly rejog my memory on subjects I have previously researched. I like solving puzzles, playing brain teaser games,
                and learning about different cultures. I am an avid traveler who can't help but plan our next vacation before we even get back from our current one! I hope to one day travel to at least 5 different continents. With traveling, comes my other hobby of staying fit. 
                From running on the beach carrying stones in Tulum to hiking up the steep streets in San Francisco, I can find any place to get in a good sweat. Not only is it good for my body, but I feel more alert and in better spirits everytime I work out. The ability to alleviate stress and forget about the struggles and blockers of the day is vital for me. 
                Another reason why I like to work out is because I like to cook. I can often be found smoking something on the grill or making something to have the family to taste-test in the kitchen. Of all my hobbies, 
                my very favorite is spending time with my family.</p>

                <h1>Why am I here?</h1>
                <strong>Why do I want to be a software engineer?</strong>
                <p>I have always wanted to work with computers even from a very young age. As a kid I would take apart my RC racing cars to see how they worked. During disassembly I would wonder what the green card with the silver dots on it was and what they did. WHen i got into highschool I was collecting games on my ti-83 graphing calculator and downloading them for my friends. 
                    I never thought about software engineering/coding as an opporutunity as computers were too expensive, so I went another route into biomechanics because of my athletic background. The more I worked with the physical part of the machines during my IT work, the more I wanted to learn more about the brains of these machines. 
                Once I saw this program and what it could allow me to do during and after graduation, I never felt more in the right place. Software engineering gives me the freedom to be who I am and continue to learn all while providing greatly for my family. I can take these skills and gift them to my son one day so he can have the opportunity to pursue a career that is, and will forever be apart of the future.  </p>
